# Multiple-disease-prediction-system
This Webapp will be a machine learning model created using Streamlit framework. 
We will be able to choose the diseases from the navigation bar or a sidebar for which we want to make a prediction using various input values. 
These input values will be the symptoms like do you have chest pain or not, physical health data like whats your age, or blood test results like whats your blood pressure, blood type, etc. 
We will first train our model from historic data, so it can make accurate predictions.

To run this install all the requirement libraraies and run the command in the terminal // "streamlit run app.py"
